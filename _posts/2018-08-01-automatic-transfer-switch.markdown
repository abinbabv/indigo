## Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) - Fed up of constant Power Outages? Worry No More!

Automatic Transfer Switch is used to transfer the load among several power sources to ensure continuous operation of load. It is required in developing countries where frequent power failure is an intense issue. Industries, public and private sector organizations and even domestic users cannot tolerate power outage because it pushes them to lose business, interrupt in normal official work, hindrance in routine and domestic life. In this project, we have emphasized the use of good interface in terms of switching speeds and smooth transitions. Transfer switch is mostly using for computers and servers where continues power is necessary.

## Introduction

As backup power sources become more common, many people have learned about the needs and benefits of transfer switches. They know in the event of an electric utility power supply outage it is at the very least desirable to power up selected circuits in a service entrance panel to provide limited light, heat, and refrigeration. Having the option of operating a double-throw switch — or sitting back and doing nothing while the switch operates on its own — is a very appealing and safe option.

An automatic transfer switch is a device used to reroute power in special circumstances. For example, during a natural catastrophe the public utility power may go out at a hospital and the automatic transfer switch starts the back-up generator. There are a lot of issues involved in such a transfer -- not the least of which is making the decision about when it is safe to switch back to public utility power.

Automatic Transfer Switches are used to insure the continuity of power supply, although this can mean different things in different situations. In a typical home, small business or institution, continuous power may mean that a short interruption can be tolerated. For example, if a backup generator is used to supply backup power when public utility power fails, there will be a pause while the generator starts up. In a hospital any interruption of more than a few seconds may be catastrophic. There are several ways that ATS can insure that the interruption is very brief -- including batteries to fill in the gap from the cessation of public utility power to the start of backup generator supply. Some automatic switches sense the temporary dips and spikes in public utility power that precedes failure and starts up the generator before the complete failure of public power.

When you think about emergency power options for your home or business, a backup generator probably comes to mind. This provides electricity independently from the grid when the power goes out.

All wired-in generators require a transfer switch to begin delivering electricity to your lights, appliances and electronics. You have two main transfer switch options: an automatic transfer switch and a manual transfer switch. Which one you choose depends on your electrical demands, your budget and what type of business you operate.

## Why Transfer Switch?

The transfer switch is responsible for trading your home or business’s energy supply from the utility company to the backup generator. It isolates the generator from municipal power lines to protect utility repairmen from power surges caused by back feeding. This essential piece of safety equipment is required with all wired-in backup generator installations in all 50 states.

When the power goes out, everything will go dark if you have a manual transfer switch. You’ll need to grab your flashlight and go out to the generator to start it manually and connect it to the transfer switch. Then you’ll need to switch your home or business over to receive power from the generator. When utility power comes back on, you need to manually switch the power back to the utility company and turn off the generator.

The primary advantage of an automatic transfer switch is the lower cost to design, fabricate and install it. It’s also smaller in size, faster to fabricate, and easier to install and maintain than an automatic transfer switch. The extra investment required to install and maintain an automatic transfer switch may be worth it if you live in an area prone to regular power outages. A lack of power interruption is also necessary for some types of businesses, including hospitals and data centers, where losing power could have serious, even life-threatening consequences.
