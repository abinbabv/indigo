## Protect your crops & keep farming without hurting them!

Bird animal detector and repellent system is an electromagnetic sensing system that gives safety and security to human life by preventing unwanted interference of birds and animals in human habitat. 
Agricultural sector and maintenance of building infrastructure suffers great threat thanks to animal attack, this is often controlled and rectified by a repelling system incorporating a PIR sensor, ATmega328P and a frequency generator.
Implementations of such systems help maintenance of infrastructure and supply protection to human habitat. Sound is a crucial component that's utilized in communication, hence every sound or call in animals or citizenry has certain significance so this same hearing range are often wont to chase away animals and birds by emitting an ultrasonic sound which is disturbing to them.
Animals like dogs, rats and most of the birds are often driven away by this technique.
